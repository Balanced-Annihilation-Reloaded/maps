to edit:

open .tmd in WM - run as normal build and tiled build to output all necessary files
(my connection wouldn't let me upload something as big as a map texture :p)
note that outputted emerald_p.bmp additionally needs the islands border blacked out using an image editor
rename wm output files to match filenames used in .bat and then run it

run mapconv using the .bat in /build to generate smf,smt,minimap
drop those into sdd
